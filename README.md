# Design-of-a-Grayscale-Halftone-Image-Converter
ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project implements a digital image processing system on hardware (Verilog HDL) that can:

Convert a color RGB image into a grayscale image.

Apply Error Diffusion (Floydâ€“Steinberg algorithm) to generate a halftone (binary) image from the grayscale version.

Such systems are useful in printing, image compression, and low-resource multimedia displays, where storage and display devices are limited to black-and-white but still need to preserve visual quality.
The system processes images step by step:

Input: Original RGB image (24-bit, Redâ€“Greenâ€“Blue channels).

Grayscale Conversion: The image is converted into a single-channel 8-bit grayscale image, where each pixel intensity represents brightness.

Halftone Conversion: The grayscale image is transformed into a binary halftone image (only black and white pixels), simulating shades of gray through pixel distribution.
